# Accuracy audit — fix tracking

The assembly-vs-port accuracy sweep (18 subagent auditors, adversarial verification
against BLOODPRG.EXE) produced **40 confirmed candidate inaccuracies**. This tracks
their disposition. Full finding text: the workflow result for run `wf_97ed4d0c-94b`.

**Key caveat discovered during fixing:** the auditors diffed the RAW ASSEMBLY, but
several port constants were deliberately calibrated to ORACLE CAPTURES (the interpreter
running the real EXE). Where the two disagree, **the capture is what the game actually
displays** and wins. So a subset of the 40 are FALSE POSITIVES — the port is already
correct and the raw-assembly reading is the one that's off. Each geometry finding must
be oracle-re-verified before it is "fixed"; changing it blind regresses a pixel match.

## Verified FALSE POSITIVE for the PORT — finding correct for the assembly, wrong for the port's model (4)

- **`0x6946` query nuance (0xAD/AF/B2/B3/BA/BB/BC):** VERIFIED the port's query arm is
  an EXACT match for `0x6954..0x6983`: the special-object -> `0xFFFF` wildcard
  substitution (`raw==gs:[0x674e]`), the `val == rec_read(off)` compare (= `cmp ax,
  es:[bx+di]`), and the four-way inversion branch `(eq && flipped) || (!eq && !flipped)`.
  The match-anything-vs-aboard subtlety was already fixed (in-code note at the arm). No
  change — the port is faithful here.

- **subtitle console multi-line pitch (10 vs asm `add dx,8`):** the on-console 10px
  pitch is TUTORIAL4 oracle-calibrated (console rows measured at y=8/18 = pitch 10);
  the raw-assembly `add dx,8` disagrees with what the game displays here. No change.


- **choice-box `[0xadd]=1` tall-mode (+10):** the `choice_box_bob_morlock.ppm` capture
  shows the 2-row box at y=89/100 = the current `+8` formula; `+18` would put it at 84
  and break the pixel match. No change. (`choice_box_top_y` comment records this.)
- **C4 query owner-active gate (staleness judgment call):** the assembly gates the C4
  query on the owning object's active bit (`0x6CA4 test es:[di+2],1`). CORRECTION: the
  VAR *does* load initial object active bits (121/228 SCRIPT2 objects have `obj+2 bit0`
  set), so owner_active isn't uniformly false — my fix-#14 revert reasoning was partly
  wrong. CORRECTION (2026-07): `owner_object_offset` (largest object offset strictly
  below the key) is NOT an approximation — it is EXACTLY `0x6034` (which walks the
  `0x672c` directory by `+0x10` threshold with `jbe` then backs up one, i.e. the largest
  threshold strictly less than the key; verified including the equality edge). And the
  runtime active-bit LIFECYCLE is now decoded (see below): the only runtime writer is
  `0x5B8D` (a CLEAR in the C1 world path), so the C4-QUERY staleness fear was overstated.
  The query gate is still left as `active_actor==Some(off)` only because the query answers
  "is THIS actor's presentation the active one?" — a stronger condition than "object
  active" that the single-presenter model already captures; the assembly's `es:[di+2]&1`
  is necessary-but-not-sufficient, so the port's model is not wrong here.

### Active-bit lifecycle — DECODED (unblocks the C4-write/`0xC1` guards)

The object "active" bit is `object_record[+2] bit0` (object records live in the
`0x6724` segment; kind at `+0`, flags at `+2`). Enumerating every `or/and byte
[reg+2],imm` site in BLOODPRG.EXE finds **exactly one** runtime writer: `0x5B8D`
`and byte [bx+2],0xfe` in the C1 world/ship-presentation ladder (`record_type_ladder`
`0x5B38`), which only CLEARS the bit of a kind-`0x20` linked object. There is **no**
`or [reg+2],1` setter anywhere. So the runtime NEVER activates a VAR-inactive object —
for the dialogue C4 flow the active bits are effectively VAR-initial static. This makes
reading them in the C4 SET guard faithful to the game's write/branch decision (the sole
divergence is the C1-clear case, a separate subsystem the live VM does not run). The C4
mode-0 write guard is now IMPLEMENTED on this basis (see the Fixed table).

## Remaining (10) — each to be oracle-re-verified or carefully implemented

- **Geometry — choice-box x-band is now FULLY CLOSED:** all four hit-test callers
  (console box, MENU submenu, on-bridge nav-destination chooser, telephone contacts)
  route through the shared `choice_box_geometry` (decoded `0x84A1..0x84F6`), so each
  click band equals its drawn box by construction — the draw and hit-test read the same
  `console_box_kind`/labels in the same frame, so they agree whatever the box's
  anchor/width. Verified: `console_box_click_band_is_the_drawn_box_not_a_fixed_40_160`
  plus the existing nav/telephone click tests stay green.
- **Palette 128–191 bank (infra):** the "restore baked bytes" hint is WRONG — it would
  make the HUB muddy and break its capture; the cyan IS correct for the hub. The real fix
  is per-screen palette loading via the `0x5251<->0x5b58` working-buffer flow.
- **Infrastructure-gated VM guards** — the active-bit lifecycle is now DECODED (see
  above; runtime never sets a VAR-inactive object). RESOLVED on that basis: C4 mode-0
  write guards, the C4 mode-0 already-set check (both in the `0x6CC3..0x6D01` decision),
  and **`0xC1` line-record state — the live opcode is now handled** (`step()` executes the
  QUERY resolved+direct paths and the non-ship3d mode-0 SET, `0x6B4C`). What remains of the
  C1 story is only the ship-3D nav-source SET path (`write_c1_record_state_ship3d`) and the
  frontend world-click that creates C1 records (`0xB272`) — both fold into the
  nav-destination/ship-3D rewrite below, which needs the frontend ship-3D runtime, not the
  VM opcode.
- **Subtle / low visible impact / risk:** `0xA8` fin-flag + presentation-request side
  effects — DECODED (`0x67C8`): after the string copy the handler sets `gs:[0x67BD]=1`
  when the operand starts with `"fin."`, then (if `!(0x67AA&2)` and ship-active
  `0x24F3&1`/`0x274F&1`) fires a presentation request (`0x6788=7`, `0x67AA|2`,
  `0x1FB2=0`, `0x1FA3=0xFFFF`, `0xB3B=0`). CONFIRMED engine-coupled: those are
  frontend/ship-presentation flags the live VM does not hold — the "gs-flag model" the
  finding named. Not a VM-local drop-in.
- **A6 per-line C4 gate** — DECODED (`0x6647..0x6683`): the play gate is FIVE conditions
  — (1) b5 bit7 active, (2) not `0x5E64||0x67B0` busy, (3) line record `+2` bit15 (already
  shown) clear, (4) the line record's selector-`0x13` field (`matrix[0x131]`) `== 0xC4`,
  (5) `vm_condition_5` (`0x6339`) random. The live port models #1 and #5 faithfully and
  approximates #2+#4 with the GLOBAL `presentation_busy` flag. Tightening #4 to a real
  per-line record check is SUBTRACTIVE (skips lines) and needs the presentation-start C4
  field set by the `0x5816` scan — so it risks MISSING dialogue, and the dialogue
  playthrough harnesses currently pass on the approximation. Coupled to the
  presentation-record lifecycle (same subsystem as C1), not a safe drop-in. (The port
  DOES already model the tracer-path per-line gate behind `with_text_presentation_record_gating`.)
- **Also low/subjective:** bridge ring-cursor 8px snap (changes steering feel).
- **Rewrites:** nav destinations = flag-gated entity set (fabricated pyramid grid; needs
  entity world coords + active bits); A6 reveal-busy serialization handshake (VM↔frontend).
- **World-destination click — DECODED (no longer "undecoded on-planet click"):** the ship
  FSM (`0xAFA0`) calls `ship_3d_target_record_select` (`0xB2BB`) each frame, which scans
  the target list `DS:0x250B` (fallback `DS:0x2537`) and hit-tests the mouse against the
  projected target layout via `lcall 0x71E:0xC48` (gated by `0x27E6`, layout `DS:0x2AAB`/
  `DS:0x2545`). Its return is the selected target record: `0` = none, `-1` = back/exit
  (`0x24F3=0x11`), else a target. On a NEW target (`!= gs:0x251B`, `0xB21A`) it writes
  `gs:0x251B = target` (`0xB224`) and CREATES a C1 record `{0xC1, target, 0}` at
  `[0x6750]+0xa` (`0xB272`) — which the C1 ladder (`0x5B38`) then presents. So the
  world-click and the C1 subsystem are ONE mechanism: click a projected world target ->
  C1 record -> C1 presents it. Porting is thus part of the C1/ship-3D subsystem session,
  not a separate undecoded task. The remaining unknown is only the exact mouse->row
  rectangle math inside `0x71E:0xC48`.
- **Infrastructure-blocked:** ending fires on all-visited (the `rec_103A` runtime write,
  documented separately in port-validation.md).

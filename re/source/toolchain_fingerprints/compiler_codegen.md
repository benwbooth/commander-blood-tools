# Historical Compiler Codegen Matrix

This report records an initial compiler-in-the-loop matrix against ten natural-C
probes in `re/compiler_corpus`, plus two focused medium-model follow-ups.
Generated objects and listings remain ignored; the source corpus, runner,
commands, hashes, and conclusions are checked in.

Open Watcom was obtained from the Nixpkgs `open-watcom-bin` package. The Turbo
C installations are local archives outside this repository.

## Matrix

Turbo C 2.00 and 2.01 were tested in small, medium, compact, large, and huge
models with `-O -Z`. Turbo C 2.01 also covered unoptimized, `-O`, and `-Z`
variants in the small and huge models. This produced 16 configurations and 160
probe comparisons. The 50 same-model Turbo C 2.00/2.01 normalized listings were
identical.

Open Watcom C16 1.9 was tested with 386 code generation (`-3`) across all five
memory models, with and without `-ox`, and with the default Watcom register
calling convention or cdecl (`-ecc`). This produced 20 configurations and 200
probe comparisons. `wdis` listings retained the generated object-code bytes.

## Results

No Watcom configuration produced an exact mnemonic sequence or exact sequence
of encoded instruction bytes for any probe. The strongest aggregate Watcom
configuration was unoptimized huge model with its default register convention.
Its main positive signal is ABI shape: simple functions naturally receive
arguments in registers and can omit a stack frame.

In the initial ten-probe matrix, Turbo C produced the same four-mnemonic sequence as the trivial
`segment_global_gate` probe in 11 configurations, but only one of four
canonicalized instructions matched because the segment/global operand and call
target form differed. No other probe supplied a close instruction match. Turbo
C's `-S` output does not include encoded bytes, so byte equality was not scored
for those listings.

## Recovered-source follow-up

Two later recovered functions provide a stronger positive result for Turbo C
2.01 in the medium memory model with `-O -Z`:

| routine | source operations | original bytes | Turbo OMF result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `0x00A73E list_d8c_bounds_init` | four direct word stores plus `ret` | 25 | exact opcode/immediate LEDATA shape; address-word FIXUPP records at offsets 2, 8, 14, and 20 |
| `0x00A744 list_d8c_wrap_bounds_reset` | three direct word stores plus `ret` | 19 | exact opcode/immediate LEDATA shape; address-word FIXUPP records at offsets 2, 8, and 14 |

The object payloads contain zero placeholders where the original has
`0x0D60`, `0x0D62`, `0x0D64`, and `0x0D66`; the adjacent FIXUPP records cover
exactly those words. Binding the four external globals to their recovered data
offsets therefore supplies the original instruction bytes. The two entrypoints
share the tail beginning at `0x00A744`, so reproducing their overlapping linked
layout remains a separate translation-unit/linker problem.

Open Watcom 1.9 medium instead materializes zero and `0xFFFF` in AX before
storing, producing 18-byte and 15-byte routines that clobber AX and flags. It
does not match these routines. Turbo C and Watcom medium both preserve the core
signed subtract/compare order of the `0x008269` and `0x008295` hit tests, but
neither reproduces their live SI/BP pointer ABI or the latter routine's carry
return from ordinary C declarations.

The `0x0030CD` text-width probe is a useful near miss. Open Watcom 1.9 medium
`-3 -ox` emits 60 bytes and 31 instructions versus the original 57 bytes and 28
instructions, with the same two-table selection, byte lookup, word accumulation,
subtract-two result, preserved BX/CX/SI/DI, and far return. It still passes the
text pointer in AX and selector in DX, addresses tables through DS, and uses
MOVZX loads rather than the original AX selector, DS:SI text, GS-prefixed XLAT
and indexed advance read. Turbo C 2.01 medium uses stack arguments and a stack
frame, so neither result reproduces the routine boundary.

For `0x007CB4`, Turbo C 2.01 and Open Watcom 1.9 medium preserve the recovered
signed table index, big-endian row construction, set-bit-only writes, fixed
framebuffer offset, and 320-byte row advance. They emit 51 and 40 instructions
respectively, versus the original 26, and do not reproduce its compact
LODSW/XCHG/shift-until-zero/LOOP form or register effects. The natural source is
therefore behaviorally verified but remains a codegen mismatch.

An exact raw-byte search of 307 recovered BLOODPRG routines of at least eight
bytes over all 20 files in each Turbo C `TC/LIB` tree found zero matches for
both versions. For example, Turbo C 2.01's `CH.LIB` `_strlen` member is a
34-byte stack-argument routine, while BLOODPRG `0x002665` is a 19-byte
register-entry helper using `ES:DI` and `repne scasb`.

Representative best Watcom result per probe, ranked by canonical instruction
LCS and then mnemonic similarity:

| probe | best configuration | original/generated instructions | instruction LCS | mnemonic LCS | byte-line LCS |

| `far_strlen` | compact, unoptimized, register | 11/15 | 0.0909 | 0.6364 | 0.0909 |
| `field_offset` | compact, `-ox`, register | 8/23 | 0.3750 | 0.7500 | 0.3750 |

| `vm_c9_record_clear` | compact, unoptimized, register | 26/38 | 0.0769 | 0.5769 | 0.1154 |
| `vm_dic_lookup_result` | compact, unoptimized, cdecl | 21/42 | 0.2381 | 0.6190 | 0.2381 |
| `vm_special_slot_insert` | huge, `-ox`, register | 21/52 | 0.1905 | 0.7619 | 0.1905 |

## Interpretation

The initial matrix rejects Turbo C 2.00/2.01 as a blanket default for those ten
tested formulations and ABI shapes. The exact medium-model initializer results
show that Turbo C 2.01 remains a viable generator for at least some recovered
translation units. They do not identify the whole executable's compiler or
exclude hand-written assembly.

Open Watcom 1.9 is a better structural lead because its default register ABI
resembles many recovered entry conventions, but it is not an exact match and is
not a period-specific compiler identification. Continue to treat the original
assembly as the oracle, test older compiler versions when available, and accept
natural C one routine at a time only after its ABI and generated code are
accounted for.

## Reproduction

Use the direct runner commands in `re/compiler_corpus/README.md`, then emit the
comparison JSON with:

```sh
python3 re/tools/compiler_corpus.py --compare
```

Repeat the Turbo library search with:

```sh
python3 re/tools/compiler_corpus.py \
  --scan-library tc20=/path/to/tc20/TC/LIB \
  --scan-library tc201=/path/to/tc201/TC/LIB \
  --min-routine-bytes 8
```
